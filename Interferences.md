# interfaces 
interfaces are used to define the structure of an object.
- An interface is a contract that defines a set of methods but does not provide their implementations.

# implementing interfaces 
In TypeScript, implementing interfaces is a way to enforce that a class adheres to a particular structure or contract. When a class implements an interface, it must include all the properties and methods specifie

- Every property that it implements needs to be defined in class , diff to implements in java where its OOPS concept ie class implements properties of interference.

- .js file will not have any implements as JS doesnt support that. its something that TS provides in addition to add more type safety to codes.
